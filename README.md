# Description of the Model

This repository illustrates a characteristic tetrahedron based approach to determine the singular configurations of motion simulator platforms

<p align="center">

The video below shows a simple trajectory followed by parallel robot showing characteristic tetrahedron and also becomes degenerate i.e becomes a plane and the point lies on the platform when the parallel robot is at singular configuration.

# Graphic Mockup

A library of graphical and computational tools has been written in order to simplify the analysis and to provide a sophisticated and effective mockup.

The characteristic tetrahedron and apex of tetrahedron are visualized and seen normally for a working configuration of parallel robot (Minimal simplified symmetric manipulator) is shown in the graphic mockup below
